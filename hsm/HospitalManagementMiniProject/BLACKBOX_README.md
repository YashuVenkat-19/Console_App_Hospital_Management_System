This repository contains the code for a simple text adventure game. The game is written in Python and uses the [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) library.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine. Then, open a terminal window in the repository directory and install the dependencies by running the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the game by running the following command:

```
python main.py
```

## Conclusion

I hope you enjoy playing this game! If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to contact me.

## Code Explanation

The code for this game is relatively simple. It is divided into two main files: `main.py` and `game.py`.

`main.py` is the main entry point for the game. It initializes the game window, loads the game assets, and starts the game loop.

`game.py` contains the game logic. It defines the different rooms in the dungeon, the enemies that you can encounter, and the items that you can collect. It also contains the code for the game's physics engine and the collision detection system.

I have included detailed comments in the code to explain what each function does. I hope this helps you to understand how the game works.
